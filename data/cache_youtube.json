    "answer": "**Summary:**\n\nThe Internet is often misunderstood as a cloud or a bubble, but it's actually a network of wires, including fiber optics, copper, and satellite connections. These wires allow two computers connected directly to them to communicate. The Internet uses a system of unique addresses, called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, to help computers find each other. When you visit a website or send an email, your computer breaks the information into smaller packets, which are then reassembled at the destination. To prevent packets from getting lost or ending up in the wrong place, routers are used to direct them around the Internet.\n\n**Key Learning Points:**\n\n1. **The Internet is a network of wires**: It's not a cloud or a bubble, but a physical network of wires that connect computers.\n2. **Internet Protocol (IP) addresses**: Each computer, server, and device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, like a postal address, to help them find each other.\n3. **Packets**: When you visit a website or send an email, your computer breaks the information into smaller packets, which are then reassembled at the destination.\n4. **Routers**: Routers are used to direct packets around the Internet, ensuring they reach their destination and don't get lost or end up in the wrong place.\n5. **Client-server relationship**: Your computer is a client, connected indirectly to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), while servers are special computers connected directly to the Internet, hosting websites and storing data.\n6. **How data travels**: When you visit a website, your computer sends packets to the server hosting the website, which then sends packets back to your computer, with routers helping to direct the packets along the way.\n\n**Further Learning:**\n\n[Watch: How the Internet Works](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+the+internet+works)\n[Watch: Internet Basics](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=internet+basics)\n[Watch: IP Addresses and Routers](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ip+addresses+and+routers)",

    "answer": "So, you know how we can use the internet to play games, watch videos, and talk to our friends? But have you ever wondered how it all works?\n\nThe internet is like a big network of wires that connect computers all around the world. It's not a big cloud in the sky, but rather a bunch of wires that are buried underground or in the air.\n\nWhen you want to visit a website, like Google or Facebook, your computer sends a message to a special computer called a server. The server is like a big library where all the information is stored. It has a special address, called an IP address, that helps your computer find it.\n\nImagine you're sending a letter to your friend. You would write their address on the envelope so the mailman knows where to take it. It's kind of like that with the internet. Your computer sends a message to the server with the IP address, and the server sends back the information you asked for.\n\nBut how does the information get from your computer to the server? That's where the routers come in. Routers are like special helpers that make sure the information gets to the right place. They're like a team of mailmen who work together to deliver the letter.\n\nWhen you send a message or visit a website, your computer breaks it down into tiny pieces called packets. These packets are like little pieces of candy that are wrapped in layers. Each layer has the IP address of the next router, so the packets can follow the right path to get to the server.\n\nWhen the server sends back the information, it creates new packets with the same layers, so they can follow the same path back to your computer. It's like a game of telephone, where each person whispers the message to the next person, and it gets back to the first person in the end.\n\nSo, that's how the internet works! It's like a big team of helpers working together to deliver information from one computer to another.\n\n**Further Learning:**\n- [Watch: How the Internet Works for Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXsomnDkntI)\n- [Watch: Internet Basics for Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXsomnDkntI)\n- [Watch: How the Internet is Like a Mail System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXsomnDkntI)",

In the next few minutes, I'll put you in the top 10% of people who understand how the Internet actually works. For SecurityCatalyst.com, I'm Aaron Titus. Whenever most people think of the Internet, this is what comes to mind. The Internet is not a bubble cloud, even in the new age of cloud computing. The whole fuzzy cloud picture was created by people more concerned about job security than education. This is the Internet. The Internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground. It might be fiber optics, copper, or occasionally beamed to satellites or through cell phone networks, but the Internet is simply a wire. The Internet is useful because two computers connected directly to this wire can communicate. A server is a special computer connected directly to the Internet and web pages are files on that server hard drive Every server has a unique Internet Protocol Address or IP address Just like a postal address, IP addresses help computers find each other. But since 72.14.205.100 doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, we also give them names like google.com, facebook.com, or securitycatalyst.com. So this is how it works. Your computer at home is not a server, because it's not connected directly to the Internet. Computers you and I use every day are called clients, because they're connected indirectly to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Here, we'll pretend that this is my home laptop, and I'm using DSL. Now let's pretend that I want to visit AOL.com, which is, coincidentally, both a server and an ISP. I hop onto my laptop with DSL, go through my ISP, onto the internet, and look at AOL.com. My computer connects with AOL.com and I can look at its webpages. Now, let's say that I want to send an email to Aunt Ruth. Aunt Ruth has AOL dial from home and I got a Gmail account I log onto Gmail and compose a message to Aunt Ruth email address auntruthataol Once I click send gmail sends the email to aol The next day Aunt Ruth dials into AOL servers and retrieves the email. Whenever an email, picture, or web page travels across the internet, computers break the information into smaller pieces called packets. When information reaches its destination, the packets are reassembled in their original order to make a picture, email, webpage, or tweet. Okay, so imagine you're at work sitting next to your boss, and you're both surfing online. Your boss is doing market research, and you're updating your Facebook profile. You're both sending packets back and forth over the internet. But what's to keep your packets from accidentally ending up on your boss's screen? That could be embarrassing. The solution to that problem is IP addresses and routers. Everything connected directly or indirectly to the Internet has an IP address. Everything. That includes your computer servers cell phones and all of the equipment in between Anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersect there a piece of equipment called a router Routers direct your packets around the internet helping each packet get one step closer to its destination. Every time you visit a website, upwards of ten to fifteen routers may help your packets find their way to and from your computer. Imagine each packet as a piece of candy wrapped in several layers. The first layer is your computer's IP address. Your computer sends the packet to the first router, which adds its own IP address. Each time the packet reaches a new router, another layer is added until it reaches the server. Then, when the server sends back information, it creates packets with an identical wrapping. As the packet makes its way over the Internet back to your computer, each router unwraps a layer to discover where to send the packet next until it reaches your computer and not your boss's. And that's how the internet works, in five minutes or less, and you're now easily in the top 10% of people who understand the basics of the internet.
