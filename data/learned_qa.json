  "who's doraemon?": {
    "question": "Who's Doraemon?",
    "answer": "Doraemon is a popular Japanese manga and anime series created by Fujiko F. Fujio. The story revolves around a robotic cat named Doraemon who travels back in time from the 22nd century to help his friend Nobita, a young boy who is often depicted as being lazy and not very clever.\n\nDoraemon is equipped with various gadgets and tools from the future that help Nobita in his daily life and adventures.

  "write a code to join html code to python code": {
    "question": "write a code to join html code to python code",
    "answer": "I can help you with that. However, please note that joining HTML code with Python code is typically done using a library called Flask or Django for web development, or by using a GUI framework like Tkinter or PyQt for desktop applications.\n\nThat being said, here's a simple example using Flask, a popular Python web framework:\n\n**app.py**\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return render_template(\"index.html\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n**templates/index.html** (create a new folder called \"templates\" and add this file inside it)\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My Web Page</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Welcome to my web page!</h1>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nTo run this code, save both files in the same directory and run `python app.py` in your terminal. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the HTML page rendered by Flask.\n\nFor a desktop application, you can use a GUI framework like Tkinter. Here's an example:\n\n**gui.py**\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import ttk\n\nclass Application(tk.Tk):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.title(\"My GUI App\")\n        self.geometry(\"300x200\")\n\n        # Create a label with HTML content\n        label = ttk.Label(self, text=\"<html><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1></body></html>\", justify=tk.LEFT)\n        label.pack(padx=10, pady=10)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = Application()\n    app.mainloop()\n```\n\nThis code creates a simple GUI window with a label containing HTML content.\n\n**YouTube Search Links:**\n\n[Watch: Flask Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flask+tutorial+for+beginners)\n[Watch: Tkinter Tutorial for Python](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tkinter+tutorial+for+python)\n[Watch: HTML and CSS Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=html+and+css+tutorial+for+beginners)",
