      "detailed_explanation": "Real numbers include rational numbers, such as integers and fractions, and irrational numbers, such as square root of 2 and pi. Class 9 introduces the idea that not all numbers can be written exactly as fractions, which is a major conceptual shift for students. Rational numbers include integers, fractions, terminating decimals, and recurring decimals. In Class 9, students learn to distinguish clearly between terminating, recurring, and non-recurring decimals. Irrational numbers challenged early mathematicians because they showed that not all quantities can be measured exactly. Examples include √2, √3, and π. Class 9 introduces geometric methods to locate irrational numbers accurately on the number line, showing that abstract numbers still have physical meaning.",
